    "I'm Gautam Kumar Pandey, currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Technology with a specialization in Information Technology from Muzaffarpur Institute of Technology. I've had the pleasure of diving deep into the world of web development during my six-month paid internship at Deep Thought. There, I honed my skills as a full-stack web developer, working on everything from creating APIs for store functionalities like ordering and wishlists to crafting sleek admin panels. Additionally, I managed deployment using AWS EC2 and integrated Razorpay payment gateway for seamless transactions. Post-internship, I embarked on three real-life projects, all of which are live and kicking. Firstly, 'Mark My Attendance,' a platform designed to efficiently manage the attendance data of thousands of engineering and polytechnic students across Bihar. Then, there's 'Fiesta Junoon,' a website facilitating student registrations for various events during Fiesta. Lastly, the 'NPTEL College Students Record Management' system, aiding in organizing student data from examinations and preventing course duplication. My tech arsenal includes JavaScript, TypeScript, React.js, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. Besides, I'm well-versed in Java, Spring Boot, Next.js, Python, SQL, Microservices, and Apache Kafka. Beyond my professional endeavors, I've also delved into problem-solving, tackling over 750 DSA questions on Geeks for Geeks and more than 200 CP problems on CodeChef. In essence, I'm a passionate and versatile individual with a knack for turning ideas into tangible digital solutions. Looking forward to exploring more avenues and making meaningful contributions in the world of technology.",
